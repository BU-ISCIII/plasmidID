#1. Fasta file for annotation
#2. Name given to this annotation 
#3. Alignment %Identity necessary to include the sequence
#4. Alignment %Length neccesary to include the sequence
#5. Query divisor for the sequence name. (ie. For name Inc_NC_632542_protein-description)
#6. Query field to represent (l:left|r:rigth) (ie. with divisor "_", left would be "Inc" and rigth "protein-description")
#7. Unique. Each sequence will be allowed only once per plasmid
#8. Color. Color used to represent this database (blue, green, grey, orange, purple, red, yellow. vvl,, vl, l, d, vd and vvd stands for very v), light(l) and dark(d))
